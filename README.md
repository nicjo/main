Nic and Hanna Drop BredCrumbz
================================================

A concise central function that creates paths (leaves a trail of breadcrumbs behind you or program manually). With lots of possible applications from the users side and many many extra features coming from the minds of the development team. 

**Example use cases:**

* If you're constantly hunting down your car after a movie or day shopping, set a breadcrumb trail from your spot to the elevators or main entrance of the complex that you can follow back at the end of the day.

* Meeting friends at a festival, an amusement park, on the beach? Send them a path to where you set up camp (have them swing by the concession stand for you too, while you're at it).

* Secret party? Exclusive sale? Pop-up exhibition? Invite your guests with a trail of 'Crumbz or send a path out as a promotional too. 



**Resources used to begin the coding of this project:**

Before getting started with the project, please take some time to read *and* understand the following articles:

*   [Displaying data with JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/displaying-data.html)

*   [JSX in depth](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html)

*   [Interactivity and dynamic UIs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/interactivity-and-dynamic-uis.html)

*   [Multiple components](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/multiple-components.html)

*   [The React way: getting started tutorial](https://blog.risingstack.com/the-react-way-getting-started-tutorial/)

    **NOTE**: we will not be building a so-called "isomorphic" application so you may skip that part of the article.

*   [Five practical examples for learning React](http://tutorialzine.com/2014/07/5-practical-examples-for-learning-facebooks-react-framework/)

    **NOTE**: make sure to reproduce each of the five examples on your own!

    **NOTE 2**: in the last example, the tutorial uses jQuery to do AJAX. Try to do it with [`isomorphic-fetch`](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch)

*   [Introduction to `react-router`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/blob/master/docs/Introduction.md)

    **NOTE**: routing is a concept you are already familiar with, but on the server side.

    As far as we are concerned, routing is the process of deciding what to display based on the current URL.

    On the server side, we are using the Express library to help us do our routing. For example, we tell Express that we want to handle **`GET`** requests to `/content/:id`. When a request comes along for this URL, Express knows which function to call.

    Routing in the browser is similar: we already saw that we could induce a change of the URL in the browser without refreshing the page, by using the [History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API) provided by the browser. Similarly, [we can get notified when the URL changes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onpopstate) due to the back or forward buttons being clicked.

    If we put these two concepts together, we can write JavaScript code for the browser that can decide what to display based on the current URL. We can do it manually, but `react-router` does it for us :)

**Base structure**
Our application will be built to run in the browser. This means we will not be needing our own server nor database. However, **we need to serve our files somewhere**. For this reason, a tiny web server was created at `server.js`. All you have to do is run it with `node server.js`. You should not need to restart it nor modify it.

This repository already contains a base structure to get you started:

* `src`: Source directory that contains all your HTML, CSS and JavaScript code
* `src/index.html`: This will load our application. Since it's an all front-end app, everything happens in here :)
* `src/js`: Will contain your JavaScript code
* `src/css`: Your stylesheet
* `.babelrc`: tells Babel what to transform. In our case, it will transform JSX to React calls, and ES6 to "regular JavaScript"
* `.gitignore`: tells Git to ignore some files. `node_modules` can be installed with NPM
* `package.json`: contains the project dependencies as well as some scripts that we can `npm run`
* `README.md`: This file ;)
* `server.js`: Runs a tiny web server that always sends `index.html` by default
* `webpack.config.js`: Configuration for Webpack

To start hacking on this project:

1. `npm install`
2. Start the server and Webpack with `npm start`
3. Start coding!
